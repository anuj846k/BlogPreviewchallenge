## My process
My process was simple. Let me explain my approach. I began by creating a main '<div>'. Inside that, I fashioned a card '<div>' and centered it. Within the card '<div>', I added an '<img>' tag, text, and a footer. It's important to note that the card '<div>' is set to display: flex, and the flex-direction is set to column, ensuring that all elements appear in a column layout.

Now, regarding the footer, I included an '<img>' tag and an '<h4>' tag. I created space between them by adjusting the margin-left and margin-right properties. For spacing at the top and bottom, I added some pixels to the margin-bottom and margin-top. And that sums up the styling. At some point, I encountered a challenge, and I sought help from seniors in the Discord server of Frontend Mentor.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- bootstrap



### What I learned

I learned about many things like i was confused between display flex a lot before as i was just going through the tutorials but i was not practising that but when i actually did it practically ,everything got cleared so yeah project>>>>>tutorials in my opinion..


### Useful resources

- [Example:- resource 1](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/card/) - This helped me for understanding layout of cards making. I really liked this tool but not recommed to use as a pure beginner you should have basic understanding of css.
- [Example:- resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-shadow) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand text shadow and many things which i didn't knew about. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
